    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 23 February 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Summary:</strong> homeAImatch is a property matching platform. Buyers use it to find properties; agents use it to receive leads. By using the platform, you agree to these terms. We process personal data under GDPR. You can delete your account at any time.
    </div>

    <h2>1. About homeAImatch</h2>
    <p>homeAImatch ("we", "us", "the Platform") is operated by Miguel Fernandes, based in Cork, Ireland. The Platform provides an AI-powered property matching service that connects home buyers with estate agents and property listings.</p>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of homeaimatch.com and all related services. By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use homeAImatch. By creating an account or using the Platform, you represent that you are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Buyer Accounts</h3>
    <p>Buyers may use the Platform's lifestyle quiz and property matching features. By submitting your details through the contact form, you consent to your name, email address, and message being shared with the relevant estate agent or property owner.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Agent Accounts</h3>
    <p>Estate agents and property professionals may create accounts to manage listings, receive buyer leads, and use the agent dashboard. By registering, you represent that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are a licensed or authorised estate agent, or are otherwise legally permitted to advertise properties for sale in your jurisdiction</li>
      <li>All property listings you add are accurate and you have authority to list them</li>
      <li>You will respond to buyer enquiries in a timely and professional manner</li>
      <li>You will not upload misleading, fraudulent, or discriminatory property information</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.3 Account Security</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your account.</p>

    <h2>4. Property Listings</h2>
    <p>Agents are responsible for the accuracy of property listings, including price, location, descriptions, and images. homeAImatch does not verify listings and is not responsible for errors or misrepresentations in property information.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to remove listings that are inaccurate, misleading, discriminatory, or in breach of these Terms, without prior notice.</p>
    <p>Images uploaded must be owned by or licensed to the agent. By uploading images, you grant homeAImatch a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to display them on the Platform.</p>

    <h2>5. AI-Powered Matching</h2>
    <p>homeAImatch uses artificial intelligence to match buyer preferences with property listings. Match scores and AI-generated buyer personas are provided as indicative tools and should not be relied upon as the sole basis for any property decision.</p>
    <p>The AI matching system is not a property valuation tool, financial advice, or legal recommendation. We do not guarantee the accuracy of match scores or AI-generated content.</p>

    <h2>6. Lead Credits & Payments</h2>
    <p>Agent accounts include a free tier with limited lead credits. Paid lead packs and subscription plans are available. All prices are in Euros (€) unless otherwise stated.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free tier:</strong> 3 leads, 3 listings. No credit card required.</li>
      <li><strong>Lead packs:</strong> One-time purchase. Credits do not expire.</li>
      <li><strong>Unlimited plan:</strong> €99/month with a 6-month minimum commitment. After 6 months, continues month-to-month, cancellable at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When lead credits are exhausted, new leads will be received but buyer contact details will be hidden until credits are replenished or the plan is upgraded. No leads are lost.</p>
    <p>Refunds are available within 14 days of purchase if no lead credits have been used, in accordance with EU consumer rights.</p>

    <h2>7. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Platform for any unlawful purpose</li>
      <li>Upload false, misleading, or discriminatory property listings</li>

      <li>Use the Platform to send spam or unsolicited commercial messages</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Platform's infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Property listing content (text and images) remains the property of the uploading agent or their client, subject to the display licence granted in Section 4.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>homeAImatch is provided "as is" and "as available". We do not warrant that the Platform will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that AI-generated content will be accurate. We are not a party to any property transaction and bear no responsibility for the outcome of buyer-agent interactions.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, homeAImatch's total liability for any claims arising from your use of the Platform shall not exceed the amount you have paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or €100, whichever is greater.</p>
    <p>We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including loss of profit, data, or business opportunity.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may close your account at any time by contacting us at hello@homeaimatch.com. We may suspend or terminate your account if you breach these Terms, with or without notice.</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your data will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Ireland. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland, without prejudice to any mandatory consumer protection provisions that may apply in your country of residence.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>

  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <!-- AI DISCLOSURE -->
  <!-- ============================================================ -->
  <div id="ai" class="section">
    <h1>AI Disclosure</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 23 February 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Transparency:</strong> homeAImatch uses artificial intelligence as a core part of our service. We believe in being transparent about how AI is used, what it can and cannot do, and how your data is handled.
    </div>

    <h2>1. How We Use AI</h2>
    <p>homeAImatch uses Claude (developed by Anthropic) to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Match properties to buyers:</strong> Your lifestyle quiz answers are analysed by AI to score how well each property in our database matches your preferences</li>
      <li><strong>Generate buyer personas:</strong> A summary profile is created from your quiz answers to help agents understand your needs</li>
      <li><strong>Provide match reasoning:</strong> The AI explains why specific properties were recommended to you</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Limitations</h2>
    <p>AI-generated content is indicative and may contain inaccuracies. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Match scores are estimates based on available data, not guarantees of suitability</li>
      <li>Buyer personas are AI interpretations and may not perfectly reflect your preferences</li>
      <li>The AI does not have access to information not provided in the quiz or property listing</li>
      <li>The AI does not provide financial, legal, or professional property advice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Handling</h2>
    <p>When processing your quiz answers, we send them to Anthropic's API. Anthropic does not use API data to train their models. Your data is processed in transit and not stored by Anthropic beyond the duration of the API request.</p>

    <h2>4. Human Oversight</h2>
    <p>No fully automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effects are made about you. AI assists in matching and scoring, but all property decisions are made by you and the agents you interact with.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Under GDPR Article 22, you have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing. If you believe an AI-generated output has affected you unfairly, contact us at hello@homeaimatch.com and we will review the matter manually.</p>
